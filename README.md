# Cramer Rule JS

This is a simples JS code that calculates the Cramer rule up to 4 variables.
The simple html makes it easy and direct to know were to place the values.
Sadly it only supports integers.
As result we have:
  -The determinant from the coeficient matrix;
  -The determinant from the alpha matrix;
  -The determinant from the beta matrix;
  -The determinat from the gamma matrix (if three coeficients);
  -The determinant from the theta matrix (if four coeficients);
  -Tha values of alpha, beta, gamma, and theta.
